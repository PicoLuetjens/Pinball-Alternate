# Pinball

This is a 3rd Semester Fun Project that i have been developing. It is a Pinball where you can define the playground by yourself. Unfortunally it is not that stable at the moment...
Also the menu background video file was to large to upload to github. However you can just replace it with any video file you want, name it "menu.mov" and out it in the
data folder. It will be read from there. But make sure to make it as short as possible(maybe 5-10 seconds) so Processing runs smoother when playing back.

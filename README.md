<br>
This is a 3rd Semester Fun Project that i have been developing. It is a Pinball Game where you can define the playground by yourself. Unfortunally it is not that stable at the moment but i come back to it and update it with fun stuff from time to time.
There are two resolutions it can be played in. Default is 1280x720. IF you want to play in 1920x1080 uncomment line 286 and comment line 287 in Pinball.pde.
